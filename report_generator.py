        You are a data-driven marketing analyst.
        Below is the summary table of customer segmentation based on
        RFM analysis and K-Means clustering.

        Table:
        {table_text}

        Column definitions:
        - Recency: Days since the last purchase (lower means more recent)
        - Frequency: Number of purchases
        - Monetary: Total purchase amount

        Please write a professional business report in English addressing the following points:

        1. Describe the characteristics of each cluster (what kind of customer group it represents)
        2. Highlight key insights (e.g., which clusters drive revenue, which show signs of churn)
        3. Recommend 3–5 marketing actions for each cluster
        4. Suggest an overall strategic focus (which clusters deserve priority investment)

        Output format:
        - Use clear section headings such as “1. Cluster Overview”, “2. Insights”, etc.
        - Use bullet points for readability
        - Write in concise, natural business English

        - MAE / RMSE / R²: Forecast accuracy metrics

        3. Discuss underperforming products and improvement opportunities (pricing, promotion, inventory, etc.)
        4. Propose short- and mid-term sales strategies
